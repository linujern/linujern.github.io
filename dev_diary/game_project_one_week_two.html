								<!-- DAY 1 -->
								<h3>Monday, November 21st</h3>
								<p>On monday I arrived to school an hour early to get some work done before all us first years moved our computers to our new workstations, seated around our team mates. Once school started I spent a couple of hours getting the team set up in our new location. The rest of my day was spent creating and presenting the first sprint review to all the students and supervisors.
								<br><br>
								Oskar kept working on animations for the player character, Ellinor did more environment pieces, Felicia kept working on the enemy models and Victor continued making the guns. The programmers got started on the movement for the player and enemies. Our other designer Hari contracted a cold, meaning I would have to take on a portion of his responisbilities for the week.

								<!-- DAY 2 -->
								<hr>
								<h3>Tuesday, November 22nd</h3>
								<p>I spent the morning working with David, discussing and designing the procedural generation system to make it easier for our programmers. I then spent time making a flowchart for it and writing the system down in our design document. In the afternoon I worked on smaller miscellaneous tasks for a few hours and updated our Trello and Milanote pages. I also started writing a business email to Innersloth asking to use the likeness of their game Among Us within our project.
								<br><br>
								Ellinor was looking into fixing some issues with our wall models, and Victor worked on optimizing the guns for performance and fixing the scale of some assets. Felicia finished UVs and textures for the first enemy, and Oskar worked on animations for it, as well as creating a mock-up room. Anton kept looking into AI, David started work on the procedural generation and André got player movement working, as well as starting the shop system.
								</p>

								<!-- DAY 3 -->
								<hr>
								<h3>Wednesday, November 23rd</h3>
								<p>During the wednesday I spent some time improving our Trello page, and then moved on to designing the guns and their stats, including spreadsheets filled with more or less useful math of these stats. After lunch the team held a meeting where we discussed our focus for this sprint and the following one, concluding that we wanted a playable demo by the end of next week, and changing the size of the rooms.
								<br><br>
								The programmers all kept working on their previous day's work, and Hari was still at home battling a cold. Oskar worked on a level blockout and made a cell shader for it, while also working on animations for the enemies. Felicia made art for the merchant NPC and started work on a bomb enemy. Ellinor and Victor focused on making environments and assets.

								<!-- DAY 4 -->
								<hr>
								<h3>Thursday, November 24th</h3>
								<p>On thursday I started implementing weapons in the engine, and changed some design aspects in accordance with the previous days meeting. We decided to scale down the size of rooms to make work faster for the artists, moving from a 32:18 to 24:14 base size. Thus my co-designer Hari, who had defeated his illness, and I started working on remaking our room designs to fit the new template.
								<br><br>
								Felicia finished the bomb enemy and Ellinor continued working on environmental assets and props. Oskar made the last few animations for the first two enemies. Victor made more modular enivornment pieces and icons for upgrade pick-ups. Anton got the enemies to move, take damage, and follow the player, and David kept working on level generation. André kept working on the shop system, made mouse projection for better movement and made the camera follow the player. Hari got started doing level design and NPC dialouge.
								</p>

								<!-- DAY 5 -->
								<hr>
								<h3>Friday, November 25th</h3>
								<p>
								<br><br>
								Felicia made icons depicting each of the rooms and started modelling the final enemy robot. Oskar updated some animations for the enemies. Victor got working on the first game ready room design, but accidentally deleted it. Oof. Ellinor kept working on environmental assets and props. André made the system for the HUD, Anton got the enemy behaviour working, and David contiued work on the room generation.
