								<!-- DAY 1 -->
								<h3>Monday, April 3rd</h3>
								<p>First day of week 3, I started the day off by making some tweaks to the UI test system and started working on expanding the functionality 
								to our needs. I also started working with Felicia to assure the assets I would need were going to work precisely how I wanted and needed them
								to. Melinda and I also had a meeting where we discussed planning and work distribution, before attending the weekly sprint. We then started 
								planning a number of meetings which we would hold during the comming week.</p>

								section of the level blockout which Lucas has been working on.

								<!-- DAY 2 -->
								<hr>
								<h3>Tuesday, April 4th</h3>
								<p>Tuesday, Melinda and I sat in a meeting for most of the moring, discussing gameplay design choices. Among other things, we made some decisions
								about how the doors, locks, lock-picks and keys will work, how the progression will look and the objectives of the game. We looked into the winning 
								and losing conditions and discussed the game's narrative. Further, it was decided during the meeting that we would hold daily playtests of the game, 
								and include the whole group in these as much as possible. Every day starting next week, Melinda and I will play for 15 to 30 minutes each and have 
								the other take notes of our opinions. On all days save mondays, three other team members will play for 15 minutes each, which will mean that each 
								team member has at least 15 minutes of playtesting per week.
